  yesterday I took the impetus to listen to some of bo en's music, mainly his album pale machine, after having known about him for over a year now because of omori and some friends liking him. pretty cool! I really like the varied sound palette in his stuff, video gamey and future bassey instruments with some more acousticish stuff and weird singing and also just funny sound effects and stuff, and there's often some fun rhythm stuff to focus on in the background, various bloops and random percussions going like blblblblblblblb (the woodblock at 2:26 in be okay goes crazy) yeah I think it's pretty fun. the whimsicality of his style reminds me somewhat of some of kikuo's works, but that might just be because ive been on my kikuo kick for a while now and its at the front of my mind</p><p>
  its a pleasant surprise, since I didn't expect to like any of the songs as much as my time. I dont especially love my time or anything, but, I dont know about you but I tend to like things a lot more having heard them enough to become really familiar with them. it takes something being pretty far outside the range of my tastes for me internalizing it against my will to be something that makes the song more annoying instead of better, so I was happy to like pretty much all the songs (besides the title song) on pale machine as much. its funny that it took me this long to check out bo en, maybe it's a sign of my tastes evolving, maybe these things just need happen at their own pace, I dunno. but yeah, good stuff, would recommend</p><p>
  ..I thought this would be a place to dump random thoughts and feelings as I had them, but maybe ill also write paragraphs sometimes too? I dunno, will just see how it goes, dear me feel no obligation to put anything too long or too short, this is for you you narcissistic goofball</p><p>
